Overall Assessment: 2.9/5

Additional Comments: 

- in your `book.author_book` you are comparing a string with `self` which is an instance. This will not work

- You should also change the `author.write_book` method since a book no longer belongs to an author

- Make sure to have the correct tense for your methods. `author.author_book` should be `author.author_books`
